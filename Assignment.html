        <h2>Biography:</h2>
        <p>He was born in <b>Negotin.</b> From the birthplace of his parents he drew the second last name <b>Mokranjac</b> (<i>literally: resident of Mokranje</i>).
        He graduated from the <b>Belgrade high school</b>, and attended the natural science and mathematics section of the <b>University of Belgrade.</b><br> 
        In <b>1879</b> he traveled to <b>Munich</b> where he studied music in the class of <em><strong>Josef Rheinberger</strong></em>. After a brief break, he continued to study in <b>Rome</b> in the class of <strong><em>Parisotti,</strong></em> <b>in 1884.</b><br> 
        Returning to Serbia in <b>1884</b> he briefly became the <b>conductor</b> of the <b>Kornelije Stanković choir of Belgrade.</b>
        From <b>1885</b> to <b>1887</b> he studied music in <b>Leipzig, Germany.</b> 
        Upon his return to <b>Serbia</b> in <b>1887</b> he became the <b>conductor</b> of the <b>Belgrade singing society</b> (<i>Belgrade Choir</i>).
